# Air Transportation Analysis Project

## Challenges
1. **Handling Multilingual Data**: The database contained multilingual data, particularly in aircraft and airport names. Developing a method to standardize this data for consistent analysis was crucial.
2. **Complex SQL Queries**: Extracting meaningful information required complex SQL queries, particularly when joining multiple tables and aggregating data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Presenting data in a comprehensible and insightful manner using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn was challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient data processing and analysis in Python, given the large volume of data, was a key concern.
5. **Accuracy in Data Interpretation**: Interpreting the data correctly to make valid recommendations for the business was crucial and challenging, given the complexity of the data.

## Goal
To analyze the companyâ€™s database for identifying opportunities to increase seat occupancy rates and thereby boost profit per seat.

## Approach
The project involved diving deep into the company's operational data to identify patterns and opportunities. The key steps included:
- Importing libraries like `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Data exploration and cleaning, including handling multilingual data.
- Data visualization to analyze aircraft models, seat capacities, and flight fare distributions.
- Trend analysis of ticket bookings and revenue.
- Assessing the occupancy rate for different aircraft

## Key Learnings and Accomplishments
- Data manipulation and analysis using Python and SQL.
- Gained experience in handling and interpreting large datasets

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided valuable insights, it underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in tackling business challenges.
