# Air Transportation Analysis Project

## Challenges
Alongside the business environment challenges, several coding and data analysis challenges were encountered:
1. **Handling Multilingual Data**: The database contained multilingual data, particularly in aircraft and airport names. Developing a method to standardize this data for consistent analysis was crucial.
2. **Complex SQL Queries**: Extracting meaningful information required complex SQL queries, particularly when joining multiple tables and aggregating data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Presenting data in a comprehensible and insightful manner using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn was challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient data processing and analysis in Python, given the large volume of data, was a key concern.
5. **Accuracy in Data Interpretation**: Interpreting the data correctly to make valid recommendations for the business was crucial and challenging, given the complexity of the data.

## Goal
To analyze the companyâ€™s database for identifying opportunities to increase seat occupancy rates and thereby boost profit per seat.

## Approach
The project involved diving deep into the company's operational data to identify patterns and opportunities. The key steps included:
- Importing libraries like `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `json`.
- Data exploration and cleaning, including handling multilingual data.
- Data visualization to analyze aircraft models, seat capacities, and flight fare distributions.
- Trend analysis of ticket bookings and revenue.
- Assessing the occupancy rate for different aircraft and estimating the impact of a 10% increase in occupancy rate on annual turnover.

## Key Learnings and Accomplishments
- Mastered data manipulation and analysis using Python and SQL.
- Enhanced my skills in data visualization, revealing critical insights through various types of plots and charts.
- Developed a deeper understanding of the aviation industry's financial aspects, particularly in terms of profitability and efficiency.
- Gained experience in handling and interpreting large datasets, enabling me to draw meaningful conclusions and recommendations.
- Improved my problem-solving skills by applying theoretical knowledge to a real-world business scenario.
- Learned the significance of occupancy rates and pricing strategies in maximizing airline revenue.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided valuable insights, it underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in tackling business challenges.
